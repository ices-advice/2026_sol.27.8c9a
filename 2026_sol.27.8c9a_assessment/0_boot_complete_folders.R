# IMPORTANT: When using draft.data() multiple times, make sure to set `append = TRUE` for all entries after the first one.
# Only the first call should omit `append` or set it to FALSE to avoid overwriting data.bib.
# Also, be careful with long titles—use paste() to avoid issues with line breaks.
# If entries are missing in data.bib, taf.boot() will only copy the folders listed there.
